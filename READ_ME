## Simple script to automate the creation of bash projects

- Executable lives at `~/bin/create-bash-project`

## Basic call would be

`create-bash-project projectname`

Gives you a basic folder structure

- projectname
-- projectname -> this is the main script
-- installer -> run this to copy the main script to `~/bin` and make it executable
-- config.json -> values used in the project

## !Required

1. Need to add a directory to store logging and data created from the bash scripts that this creates.
2. Rename to `create-bash-project`
